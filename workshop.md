# Workshop on Deep reinforcement learning for infrastructure maintenance planning: Trends, opportunities and challenges

Organized by [Daniel Straub](https://www.cee.ed.tum.de/era/team/daniel-straub/) and [Kostas Papakonstaninou](https://sites.psu.edu/kpapakon/)
at the [TUM Georg Nemetschek Institute - Artificial Intelligence for the Built World](https://www.mdsi.tum.de/en/gni/home/)

---

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown a large potential to enable efficient planning of operation and maintenance of engineering systems. Recent works have shown that the approach is potentially applicable to systems of a considerable size and complexity. This workshop gathered 23 experts and researchers to review the current state of the art and discuss the main research questions and steps towards real-life application of DRL for infrastructure management.

The first part of the workshop started out by talks from senior experts, who provided an overview on the current state of the art in research and the industry perspective. This lead over to a joint discussion on the current capabilities and limits of methods and the requirements by industry. The second part of the workshop started with presentations by PhD students that led into a discussion on the most relevant and pressing research questions. Student presentations involved different decentralized DRL approaches, robust solutions and inference alternatives, parallelized DRL training, and large system implementation under several constraints.

The participants discussed recent advances of DRL for infrastructure management and identified key challenges and promising future directions. These included **scaling-up** solutions to systems with thousands of components, the role of **model** **uncertainty** on DRL-based decisions and real-life implementation, different inference and computational techniques to propagate uncertainty and past history in large systems, policy **interpretability** implications, **operational** **safety** needs, and **safe-RL**. We also touched upon **human intervention, feedback, and collaboration** in the training and implementation phases, together with the practical realities of regulations and data quality issues. Additional topics were the potential promise and challenges of transfer learning, and algorithmic implementation issues, including the role of hyperparameters. Finally, it was agreed to jointly work towards common **benchmarks** that enable testing and comparing different algorithmic solutions.

Everybody stressed the usefulness of this exchange and it was agreed to have similar meetings from time to time to discuss, exchange ideas, and experiences, and report progress. Anybody who wants to be informed about future meetings can contact daniel.hettegger@tum.de.


## Abstract

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown a large potential to enable efficient planning of operation and maintenance of engineering systems. Recent works have shown that the approach is potentially applicable to systems of a considerable size and complexity.  
 
In this workshop, we want to review the current state of the art and - in particular- discuss the open questions that should be addressed to enable real-life application of DRL for infrastructure management. The first part of the workshop includes talks by selected experts to provide an overview on the current state of the art in research as well as the industry perspective, which leads over to a joint discussion on the current capabilities and limits of methods and the requirements by industry. The second part of the workshop starts with presentations by PhD students that lead into a discussion on the most relevant and pressing research questions.
